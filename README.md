# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is a standard rock paper scissors game.
A player can choose either 1, 2, or 3 for their selected action. 
The AI opponent will randomly choose an action too. 
Depending on what both people choose determines who will win the match.

This program is written in C++ and was originally made on the Visual Studio 17 IDE.
If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions for improvements, then please let me know! 

Thanks for checking this out!
Sincerely,
Zachary Brader
